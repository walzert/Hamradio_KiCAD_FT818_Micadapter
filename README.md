# Hamradio_KiCAD_FT818_Micadapter

A simple Y-splitter for the RJ45 microfon plug of the FT818 should work with same pinout.
It routes 1:1 and breaks the pins out in pair with ground. 

The adpater could be used to connect a XLR microfon and buttons instead of the original MH31 mic. It also could be used for connecting a mircocontroller to that and build 
something like the MH-36E8J, deeper research for the commands is important.

Routing could be changed / extended add don't care about the FST/DWN/UP buttons and rout audio over CAT5 cable.
